Source code for the bot hosted at: https://poe.com/StarCoderChat

This is an an implementation of StarCoderChat model using the
[Poe-Protocol](https://developer.poe.com/api-bots/poe-protocol-specification). In order
to run this yourself, [setup modal](https://modal.com/docs/guide#getting-started), setup
a secret on modal.com with your Poe security key and your Together API Key, rename the
secret in main.py and then run `modal serve main.py`. The command will deploy this app
and output a url. Use that url to create a poe bot at: https://poe.com/create_bot?api=1
